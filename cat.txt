Der Finanz-Gigant ist der weltweit gr√∂√üte Investor in fossile Brennstoffe, einschlie√ülich neuer Kohlekraftwerke -- und damit das gr√∂√üte Hindernis auf unserem Weg zu einem sauberen, sicheren Planeten.

Dank des Drucks von Aktivist*innen aus aller Welt hat BlackRock-Chef Larry Fink k√ºrzlich einen Brief ver√∂ffentlicht: Er verspricht, sich f√ºr das Klima einzusetzen. Der Brief hat ein Beben in der Branche ausgel√∂st. Doch wirklich passiert ist seitdem nichts.

N√§chste Woche findet die j√§hrliche Hauptversammlung des Konzerns statt. Wenn wir jetzt den Druck auf BlackRock erh√∂hen, k√∂nnen die 6 Billionen US-Dollar, die der Konzern verwaltet, unsere besten Waffe im Kampf gegen den Klimawandel werden.
