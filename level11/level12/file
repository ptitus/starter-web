In the above command, you will notice that boxes are namespaced. Boxes are broken down into two parts - the username and the box name - separated by a slash. In the example above, the username is "hashicorp", and the box is "bionic64". You can also specify boxes via URLs or local file paths, but that will not be covered in the getting started guide.
